# 🛡️ Social Engineering & Phishing Simulation Report – Hackers10 Internship

This repository contains the **Social Engineering & Phishing Simulation Report** and supporting documentation created as part of my **Cyber Security Internship at Hackers10 Pvt Ltd**, conducted from **April 8, 2025 to May 8, 2025**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project was to simulate a real-world phishing attack to assess user awareness and the effectiveness of existing security training within a controlled environment. The engagement followed industry best practices and Hackers10 internship guidelines, focusing on social engineering tactics and phishing simulation to identify human vulnerabilities and recommend actionable improvements.

## 📅 Duration

**Start Date:** April 8, 2025  
**End Date:** May 8, 2025  

---

## 🧪 Methodology

The assessment followed a structured, multi-phase lifecycle:

1. **Planning**  
   - Defined scope, objectives, and rules of engagement based on internship requirements.

2. **Scenario Development**  
   - Crafted a realistic phishing campaign using a Facebook login template for maximum engagement.

3. **Execution**  
   - Deployed the campaign with Zphisher on Kali Linux, utilizing Cloudflared tunneling to generate a public phishing link.
   - Distributed the phishing link to authorized test users and monitored interactions.

4. **Analysis & Reporting**  
   - Collected and analyzed data on link clicks, credential submissions, and user responses.
   - Documented findings, assessed risk, and provided remediation recommendations.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Kali Linux** – Penetration testing environment  
- **Zphisher** – Automated phishing toolkit (with Cloudflared tunneling)  
- **Cloudflared** – Secure tunneling for public phishing page access  

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- ✅ **Credential Capture:** 100% of test users clicked the phishing link and submitted dummy credentials within minutes.
- ✅ **User Susceptibility:** No users reported or questioned the phishing attempt, indicating low awareness and a lack of reporting culture.
- ✅ **Data Capture:** Successfully collected test credentials and IP addresses, demonstrating the effectiveness of the simulation.
- ✅ **Training Gaps:** Existing security awareness measures were insufficient to prevent successful phishing attempts.
